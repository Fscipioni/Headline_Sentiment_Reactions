## Abstract
This study investigates the relationship between audience reactions and news headlines on Facebook, focusing on the platform’s “Reactions” feature, which offers nuanced emotional responses beyond the traditional “Like.” By developing a novel sentiment scoring system for Facebook Reactions and employing a hybrid model combining transformers and convolutional neural networks, we analyzed the sentiment elicited by headlines from 16 prominent U.S. news outlets.

Our methodology includes deriving sentiment scores for reactions, recalibrating neutral sentiment classifications, and categorizing headlines into binary and multiclass sentiment labels. The results reveal significant trends in headline framing across outlets, highlighting the prevalence of neutral to negative sentiments and variations in emotional engagement. Modeling efforts demonstrate the complexity of accurately predicting audience sentiment, with a BERT-CNN hybrid achieving the highest accuracy at 71% for binary classification and 55% for multiclass classification.

Our findings underscore how editorial framing and language choices influence audience sentiment, revealing potential biases and emotional undercurrents in digital news dissemination. This research contributes to responsible headline crafting by offering insights into the interplay between news media strategies and public emotional responses, with implications for promoting balanced discourse in the digital age.
